# Tetris - Project proposal

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic game **Tetris**, inspired by the original 1980s version, with a small number of gameplay modifiers that extend the original mechanics.

## What does this project do?
The project provides a playable Tetris game with:
- Standard mechanics: falling pieces, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, scoring, and game over.
- An additional transformation mechanic: pieces can be **mirrored horizontally** in addition to being rotated.
- A fast-piece mode, where some pieces fall significantly faster than others.
- A simple graphical interface and keyboard controls.

## Input and Output
**Input:**
- Keyboard input for moving, rotating, mirroring, and dropping pieces.
- Optional toggles during gameplay (e.g. mirror mode, sound).

**Output:**
- A graphical game window displaying the Tetris board.
- Visual feedback for score, game mode, and game state.

## Technical Details
- Language: Python
- GUI: Tkinter
- No external dependencies

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ with standard libraries (`tkinter`, `random`)

## How to Install and Run (Planned)

These instructions describe the expected usage once the project is implemented.

1. Download the project  
   The project code will be downloaded from a Git repository once it is created.
2. Dependencies  
   The project is planned to use only Python standard libraries, and no external dependencies will be required.

3. Run the game  
   The game will be executed using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
